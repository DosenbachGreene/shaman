# SHAMAN

Split-Half Analysis of Motion Associated Networks

<br clear="left" />

Motion impact score detects whether residual in-scanner head motion artifact spuriously inflates or obscures resting-state fMRI trait-connectivity correlations. [[preprint]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.16.520797v1)

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and start matlab.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DosenbachGreene/shaman.git
$ cd shaman
$ matlab
```

Generate simulated data.

```matlab
>> cd simulate
>> simulate % writes simulated data to sub*.mat
>> cd ..
```

Compute motion impact score for the simulated fMRI data and trait.

```matlab
>> % Construct a DataProvider object.
>> % Point to the folder containing the simulated data.
>> data_provider = SimulatedDataProvider("simulate");
>> % Feed the data into the SHAMAN algorithm.
>> % Specify names of traits to analyze.
>> shaman = Shaman(data_provider, ["trait"]);
>> % Run a few quick permutations.
>> shaman.permutations.nperm = 32;
>> % Get a table of false positive motion impact scores.
>> tbl = shaman.get_scores_as_table("score_type", ScoreType.FalsePositive)
```

```
tbl =

  1Ã—2 table

             False Positive Score    False Positive p Value
             ____________________    ______________________

    trait           103.33                     0 
```

Read the API documentation.

```matlab
>> doc Shaman
```

## How it Works

The motion impact score and SHAMAN algorithm are described [in our preprint, which you can cite](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.16.520797v1) if you find this tool useful. Briefly, we assume that the functional connectivity related to a trait of interest (e.g. score on a standardized test) does not vary from second to second. This allows us to:

 1. Split each participant's timeseries fMRI data into a high-motion and low-motion half.
 2. Generate a connectivity matrix from each half of each participant's data.

Most regression approaches for functional connectivity include between-participant head motion as a covariate. In the next step, we allow this covariate to mop up some of the residual motion artifact.

 3. Regress out between-participant differences in head motion.
 4. Subtract each participant's high-motion matrix from her low-motion matrix.

Following step 4, it is important to realize that the each participant's difference matrix should be zero (or unstructured noise). Absent motion artifact, _trait-related functional connectivity in the high- and low-motion matrices should be identical_ and should therefore cancel out during subtraction. Whatever is left must be due to motion. Thus, finally:

 5. Regress the trait of interest against the difference matrices to obtain motion impact score.
